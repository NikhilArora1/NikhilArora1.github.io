            <p>Iâ€™m a hard working and dedicated professional front-end developer/user interface designer
                with a keen eye for detail, and a determination to deliver the very highest quality. I take great pride
                in
                my work, and I always try to better myself with every project I work on.</p>
            <p>My main experience is in front-end development but I also have a passion for design. Given that producing
                a modern website requires the combination of design, server technology, and the layer that users
                interact with, I believe having experience in both design and development allows for making the most
                optimal user experiences.</p>
